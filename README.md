# Developing Data Products - Project 1
This is the first project for the Developing Data Product course from the Data Science Specialization program by John Hopkins Univertity at Coursera. The project consist of an interactive map created on R Markdown with the leafleat package.

The map I've created is a map that shows five of the most important acheologial zones in Mexico.
